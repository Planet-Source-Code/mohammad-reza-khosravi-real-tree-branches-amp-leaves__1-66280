### Description

Think 3D !

Sometimes in programming, the current loop statements such as for...next or do...while can't help us and we need more.

This is a simple and funny program that shows you how a function can refer to itself and make a loop.

I use this function to make a tree, because I like trees, but you can use it for making virus growth simulation!, if you like.

This program may help beginners learn more about graphics, mathematical algorithms, fractals, API, recursive functions, sounds and some VB controls.

I'd like to hear from you, so please leave me a note.
